# 🐎♟️ L Movement (Chess Knight) Game - Windows Forms (C#)
This project is a Windows Forms game that allows the user to move only by simply making an "L" shape. The user starts the game by selecting a square, then can only move forward with L moves that can be made from that square. The goal is to try to move all 64 squares in one go or to get a high score by moving as many squares as possible.

## 🎮 Game Rules and Mechanic
- The game is played on an 8x8 (64 square) area.
- The player starts the game by clicking on any square at the beginning.
- According to the selected square, only the squares where he can make an L (horse) move are highlighted in red.
- The player can only click on the squares highlighted in red.
- With each new selection, new L moves that can be made from that square are calculated and highlighted.
- The game ends when all squares are visited or when a point where no moves can be made is reached.
- The score is equal to the number of squares visited.
